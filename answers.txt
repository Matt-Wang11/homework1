What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Git merge creates a merge commit combining the edits on both branches.
While git rebase creates new commits based on one branch to the target.
Essentially it adds edits made on one branch to another.

What is a remote repository?

Remote repository is versions of the project that is stored on the internet.
For example a version of the repository stored on github while you work on a
local repository.
